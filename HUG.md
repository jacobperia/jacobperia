## What is this?

This concept was introduced to me by Chris Young at [Harled Inc.](https://harled.ca/blog/why_we_value_human_user_guides). In short, this document explains my working methodology and how I work collaboratively.

## About Me

I live in Mississauga, ON, Canada with my wife. My like include experimenting with different cuisines, travelling and playing video games and my obsessions include cars and working out at the gym. 

I grew up with computers and have ever since been a slave to exploring software and also repairing and upgrading hardware.

By nature, I would say I'm introverted but in a group where I feel comfortable, I would show a more extroverted front.

## Principles and Values

I believe in:
1. Aiming for perfection in everything I do.
2. Cherishing everything I do.
3. Owning up to mistakes without feeling ashamed.
4. Being humble at all times and throwing ego into the trash.
4. Helping others out in an attempt to improve where they lack and being excited to see them succeed.

## Problem Solving

When it comes to problem solving, I usually start by planning out how I would get to a solution by looking at it from multiple angles and considering any possible edge cases

## Productivity

Working on a screen for more than 2 hours usually leads to me losing focus. I like to take very short power naps to regain my productivity whenever I feel lethargic which is also after a high-carb lunch :P. 

I love working on something that I know I can get done if I persist and I really hate to abruptly stop working on something that I'm fully invested in.

## Working with Teams

I enjoy working in a team setting although I don't have a lot of experience doing so. 
I am used to just listening to everyone give their ideas but when I have a strong opinion about something, I will not hesitate to bring it up if it would benefit everybody.

## Pet-peeves

1. When people are not prompt with my time and without explanation.
2. Lack of a certain amount of perfection in delivered work.
3. Not practicing what is preached.
4. Not keeping a minimum standard of hygiene.

## Feedback

When receiving feedback I'd love to receive the most detailed explanation possible so that there's little to no back and forth when addressing these concerns. I would also love if every change I made is looked at carefully so that all feedback is submitted together and I'm not receiving any new feedback could have been sent with the previous change requests.

## Mentoring

I personally have not been a mentor to anyone although I have helped my peers out on many ocassions. I would like to be a mentor someday in the hopes of molding a high quality developer.

And on the other hand, I have not been mentored. Everything I learned was from research and trial and error with the ocassional assistance from more Senior Devs. Code reviews have really helped improve my code quality and convention.
